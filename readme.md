- [ ] A fuller example w/ file I/O
- [ ] Remaining details -- e.g. 3 queues, select/events & async gens
- [ ] Table of contents
- [ ] Final read-through




#### What does await do?

#### How do I cede control from my coroutine to the event-loop? 

#### How does the event-loop know where to resume my coroutine from?

#### How does the event-loop know when the thing I'm waiting for is done (and whether it needs cpu-time to get there)?
