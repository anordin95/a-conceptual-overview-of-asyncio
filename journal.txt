- I don't understand why await was designed to only call __await__. Surely there's a better design?
Perhaps one where await directly cedes to the event-loop. Nothing else. Though, how to passs values back in such a scheme?

- I'm leaving TODO's in places where I need to manually address certain aspects.

- Review each hypothesis and simplify where possible.
