- I don't understand why await was designed to only call __await__. Surely there's a better design?
Perhaps one where await directly cedes to the event-loop. Nothing else. Though, how to passs values back in such a scheme?
I think it's best to address this in-line i.e. in part-2.

- Add some details about Tasks & futures (i.e. the dependent/callback tasks and marking as done). 
I think this is addressed well by part 2 and the walkthrough example [done!]

- Add a glossary for finnicky terms like async & await describing exactly what they mean/do. Hm, on second thought,
I think these are already fairly well covered.

- I'm leaving TODO's in places where I need to manually address certain aspects.

- Review each hypothesis and simplify where possible [done!]
